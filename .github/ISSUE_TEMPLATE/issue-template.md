<!-- This project is a Proof Of Concept and offers no support.  If you have an issue with the code then the assumption is made that you will figure it out yourself in the process of incorporating it's ideas into your own code. -->

<!-- If you however find a typo or other logic error in the code then I would much appreciate you pointing out the error, and if appropriate suggested code to correct the error. -->

<!-- It is also well know that Bootstrap, as a framework, is highly opinionated, and as such will attract much debate ... this is not the forum for that and recommendations to change the way things are written in this work will be, for the most, ignored.   You are however very welcome to fork from here and change to your hearts content. -->
